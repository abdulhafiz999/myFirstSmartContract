Project: SimpleStorage Smart Contract
Description:
This project contains a simple Solidity smart contract that allows users to store and retrieve a favorite number. The contract was created as part of the Hackerboost Web3 course (MC Week 1).

Steps Taken:
Set Up Development Environment:

Accessed the Remix IDE for writing and compiling the contract.
Created a new workspace named "MyFirstSmartContract."
Created a new Solidity file named SimpleStorage.sol.
Wrote the Smart Contract:

Created a smart contract that includes a favoriteNumber state variable of type uint256.
The contract allows for setting and retrieving the favorite number.
Compiled the Contract:

Used the Solidity compiler in Remix with the correct version (^0.8.25).
Compiled the contract successfully with no errors.
Deployed the Contract Locally:

Selected Remix VM (Cancun) as the environment in the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
Deployed the contract to the local blockchain.
Tested the Contract:

Successfully interacted with the deployed contract by setting and retrieving values for favoriteNumber.
